Documentation (including instruction for compilation)
-------------

We are in the process of porting the documentation to the github wiki: https://github.com/jbmouret/sferes2/wiki

Optional modules
---------------
- evolvable neural networks: https://github.com/jbmouret/nn2
- khepera-like simulator: https://github.com/jbmouret/fastsim


Design
-----
The following choices were made in the initial design:
- use of modern c++ techniques (template-based programming) to employ object-oriented programming without the cost of virtual functions;
- use of Intel TBB to take full advantages of multicore and SMP systems;
- use of boost libraries when it's useful (shared_ptr, serialization, filesystem, test,...);
- use of MPI to distribute the computational cost on clusters;
- a full set of unit tests;
- no configuration file: a fully optimized executable is built for each particular experiment.

Sferes2 is extended via modules and experiments.

Sferes2 work on most Unix systems (in particular, GNU/Linux and OSX). It successfully compiles with gcc, clang and icc.
